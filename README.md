# Backrooms-Mobs
Mobs for backrooms pack (RP and BP)
All the content for the first mob will be added within a week of adding this to the readme after the starting bugs are fixed.
On top of the initial license, I would appreciate if I was notified before the redistribution of the content, however you are not obliged to.
Contact info: peithonic@gmail.com
PSA that when downloading multiple copies to edit, the uuids of both manifests must be changed before trying to test/import.

License located in the Backrooms-Mobs section is for all software.
Both Licenses located in the BP and RP sections target only the pack_icon.png
