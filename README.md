# Backrooms-Mobs
Mobs for backrooms pack (RP and BP)
Each mob will be added in full. I try to complete 1 every 1-2 months. Each mob I also try to make as lore accurate as possible in accordance to the BackRooms Wiki: https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entities
If I can't match the behavior I try to make it similar. If you have any suggestions on how to make it better you can email me. 
On top of the initial license, I would appreciate if I was notified before the redistribution of the content, however you are not obliged to.

PSA that when downloading multiple copies to edit, the uuids of both manifests must be changed before trying to test/import.
Sound effects are typically taken from voicemod.net textures/models are inspiration from images. 

Current Mobs:
Bacteria (sounds in development), 
Smiler (in development).

If there is a single issue with ANY mob please contact me.

License located in the Backrooms-Mobs section is for all software.
Both Licenses located in the BP and RP sections target only the pack_icon.png
