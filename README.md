# Backrooms-Mobs
Mobs for backrooms pack (RP and BP)
Each mob will be added in full. I try to complete 1 every 1-2 months. Each mob I also try to make as lore accurate as possible in accordance to the BackRooms Wiki: https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entities
If I can't match the behavior I try to make it similar. If you have any suggestions on how to make it better you can email me. 
On top of the initial license, I would appreciate if I was notified before the redistribution of the content, however you are not obliged to.
Contact info: peithonic@gmail.com / https://discord.gg/UP86z5vkmv (I will respond to discord more, emails rarely get checked)
PSA that when downloading multiple copies to edit, the uuids of both manifests must be changed before trying to test/import.
Sound effects are typically taken from voicemod.net textures/models are inspiration from images.
